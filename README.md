### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have been validating for about 3 years and all this time my nodes worked flawlessly and were constantly active, I was also always in the top 100 active validators of various projects.

 Iâ€™m working on my own crypto project, but I need a lot of time.
 
  Iâ€™m interested in crypto currencies and metaverse.
  
   I'm node runner and validator, crypto enthuasist, contributor, content creator.
